# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief, and functions as a webpage where users can find information about the cafe and make a reservation to dine in.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

### Plan on improving the project

I feel as though the webpage is a little stagnant. To improve it, I would add some more moving parts to each page. Additionally, I would make it more uniform and aesthetically pleasing to browse through by following a color scheme.
